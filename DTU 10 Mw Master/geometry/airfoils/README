These are the original coordinates for the FFA-W3-XXX
airfoils.

In addition to these an FFA-W3-480 airfoil has been created
which was used to generate the blade.

These airfoils do not include the Gurney flaps added to the inner part of
the RWT blade, see the CFD/2D/FFA_w3XXX directories for these airfoil geometries.
