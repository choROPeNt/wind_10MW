The composite layup of the DTU 10MW reference blade is defined in terms of a 
stacking-sequence of layers representing multidirectional plies. 
One table defines the layup for each of the 11 circumferential regions.
This directory contains these tables as simple text files.
The stacking sequence is defined from the outer surface (first column) 
to the inner surface (last column). Some circumferential regions have 
identical layup as described in the report.
