The steady state operational data for the DTU 10MW RWT was computed
using HAWCStab2 v2.4. See the report for further details.

Two sets of operational data are available:

1) DTU_10MW_RWT_hs2_no_deform.opt
    Operational data for the wind turbine configured without
    prebend, cone, tilt and blade deformation. This data is
    suitable to use for e.g. rotor CFD simulations.

2) DTU_10MW_RWT_hs2_with_deform.opt
    Operational data for the wind turbine configured with normal
    geometrical layout with prebend, cone, tilt, and includes
    blade deformation.
